## Game Scenario

You awaken in a futuristic world populated entirely by AI-driven robots. The landscape is defined by neon lights, grime-streaked streets, and concrete structures.

Your goal is to uncover the truth of this universe: what is happening here, and what became of humanity? Interact with NPCs and complete objectives to eventually reveal the truth hidden before your eyes.

## Game Design

* **NPCs:** Primarily humanoid robots featuring screens that display digital eyes and mouths.
* **Environment:** The game takes place at night to highlight neon aesthetics and rain-slicked surfaces.
* **Atmosphere:** Streets are dirty and buildings are crumbling from lack of maintenance. The technology is not overly advanced; the city resembles contemporary architecture weathered by time.
* **Interface:** A panel in the top-left corner displays the main objective and current task. A minimap is provided to assist with navigation.
* **Mechanics:** Players interact with only one object at a time. There is no inventory system.
* **Exploration:** Certain buildings and interior spaces are fully accessible.
* **Cinematics:** Short cinematic sequences are used to introduce or illustrate pivotal scenes.
